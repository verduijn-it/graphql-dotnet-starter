# graphql-dotnet-starter

Setting up a graphql endpoint using graphql-dotnet can be daunting task. Especially when you lack previous experience with .NET Core backends. Because of that, we created graphql-dotnet-starter. This starter kit helps you get up and running in no time, and provides a development environment with all the goodies you expect when building a graphql endpoint. Reasons to use this starter kit are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭐  **Up and running in no time. Zero configuration.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭐  **Fully automated CI/CD pipelines with dotnet and docker workflows using Github actions.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭐  **Out of the box tooling suchs as (GraphQL Playground and GraphQL Voyager).**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⭐  **More performance compared to your usual node based Graphql endpoint.**  

## Prerequisites
